 * The class will filter the actions and consider which one is more important. To fill it

 * Use the method CaoFactory.fillWithActions() to fill it correctly. The method will first ask the drivers of the
 * elements to fill this list. The drivers are asking the CaoApplications and it will ask the CaoConnection by default
 * You can change this behavior by overwriting the method in it's extended classes.
